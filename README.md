In this project, I created a PCB design using KiCad 7.0. 
I utilized an Arduino Nano, which was soldered onto the circuit after printing, and connected it to two modules: a thermocouple and an LCD display. 
The system was designed to operate on 230V from the socket to power hot plates and regulate their temperature.
